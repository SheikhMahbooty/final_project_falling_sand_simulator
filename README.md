# Falling Sand Simulator

A simple yet fascinating physics sandbox game where particles (like sand) fall and interact naturally, built using **Python** and **Pygame**.

This project is based on the YouTube tutorial by [Programming With Nick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKv6CwOiIlU), who deserves full credit for the original concept and implementation.
